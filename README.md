## Help wanted

In the future, we're planning to integrate more CI systems. If you're running a not yet supported one, and want to test the integration with [cvrg.report](https://cvrg.report), please create an [issue](https://github.com/cvrg-report/ci-tests/issues) with the `test-help`. 

## Suggesting new CI integrations

We are very open to add support for other CI solutions than the already existing. If you want to suggest another CI system to be added, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cvrg-report/ci-tests/issues) with the label `ci-suggestion`. Thanks a lot in advance!
