# Integration tests for CI systems for cvrg.report

This project was created to evaluate if the shell script uploader for [cvrg.report](https://cvrg.report) work with the following CI systems:

* [Travis CI](http://www.travis-ci.org)
* [CircleCI](http://www.circleci.com)
* [Codeship](http://www.codeship.com)
* [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/)
* [Shippable](http://www.shippable.com)

In the future, we're planning to test the support of more CI systems, like

* Jenkins
* Wercker
* AppVeyor
* Drone CI

If you want to suggest another CI system to be added, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cvrg-report/ci-tests/issues).
